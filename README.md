KittyParty
==========================================================================

A chat program where users send GIFs that correspond with their messages.

Once a user has entered the chat, they can send messages to their peers.  The message will be tokenized and "translated" into a GIF found on [Giphy](giphy.com), which will also be sent in the chat.

At the moment, if a message cannot be properly translated into something found on Giphy, Gene Wilder will tell you that you don't get a special GIF, like so...
![Cannot Translate Message](public/assets/images/gifs/NOPE.gif)

The notable technologies I worked with include JavaScript (ES6), AngularJS, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, jQuery, Sass (SCSS), RAPTORSMACSS, Gulp.js, and the Giphy API.

**WIREFRAME**: To see the project's initial wireframe (HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript, and jQuery), check out the [wireframe branch](https://github.com/AESM/KittyParty/tree/wireframe).

## ToDos

- Improve message conversion via tokenization
  + The Giphy API is not great at dealing with sentences, so the messages must be tokenized further
    * NLP research
- Create a better response if there is no return GIF
- Include database and deployment
- Create an actual sign-in and login
- Add user profile pictures or Gravatar inclusion
